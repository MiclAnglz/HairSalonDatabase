# HairSalonDatabase
DBMS Major Assignment - Microsoft SQL 
Spring Semester
Database Management and Design High Distinction

Task:
Design a complete database using Microsoft SQL for a beauty salon. I also
designed the GRD (Global Relation Diagram), ERD (Entity Relation Diagram)
complete with entity dependencies, multiplicities and entity relations.
The requirements for this project was to create a database that:

• Stores all staff and their job positions in the beauty salon

• Amongst the staff, define the staff that were therapist and the rates that
they charge for specialised therapy they provided (not all therapist
performed specialised therapy and had hourly rates. Rates also differ from
one therapist to another)

• Store all the treatments that were available at the salon and their price

• Store the details for the regular customers at the beauty salon and also the
walk ins such as:

  o treatment received
  
  o date of treatment
  
  o price they paid for the treatment
  
  o the therapist that provided the treatment
  
  o customer details phone number, email, name, etc (walk in details
were not stored)
In total 7 tables were created with multiple foreign keys for data to be
extracted accurately using complex and simple SQL queries.
