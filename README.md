they charge for specialised therapy they provided. 

<strong>note: </strong>not all therapist

one therapist to another

• Store the details for the regular customers at the beauty salon and also the
walk ins such as:

  - treatment received

  - price they paid for the treatment
  
  - the therapist that provided the treatment

In total 7 tables were created with multiple foreign keys. Both complex and simple SQL queries were used to extract data accurately.
